# Reggae Drum Kit Samples

This directory contains drum samples organized for a reggae sound pad application. The samples have been carefully selected from the 99Sounds Drum Samples collection to create authentic reggae drum patterns.

## Drum Patterns

### One Drop
The "one drop" is a classic reggae drum pattern where the kick drum "drops" on beat 3 (instead of beats 1 and 3 as in most other genres). This creates the distinctive reggae feel.

Files:
- `kick.wav` - A clean acoustic kick with good depth
- `snare.wav` - Acoustic snare with natural room sound
- `hihat-closed.wav` - Tight closed hi-hat
- `hihat-open.wav` - Open hi-hat with sustain

### Rockers
The "rockers" beat is a more driving reggae pattern with kicks on beats 1 and 3, giving it a more forceful feel than the one drop.

Files:
- `kick.wav` - Deep kick with more low-end
- `snare.wav` - Big, wide snare sound
- `hihat-closed.wav` - Hi-hat with more ring
- `hihat-open.wav` - Slick open hi-hat with shorter decay

### Steppers
The "steppers" pattern features a kick drum on all four beats, creating a driving, four-to-the-floor feel that's common in dub and modern reggae.

Files:
- `kick.wav` - Stomping kick with more attack
- `snare.wav` - Tape-processed snare with vintage character
- `hihat-closed.wav` - Slightly distorted hi-hat for edge
- `hihat-open.wav` - Tight open hi-hat with controlled decay

### Rim Shot
Rim shots are essential in reggae for accents and fills.

Files:
- `rim1.wav` - Block-like rim shot
- `rim2.wav` - Tighter, pinched rim shot

### Percussion
Additional percussion elements common in reggae music.

Files:
- `tambo.wav` - Tambourine for adding high-end rhythm
- `shaker.wav` - Shuffle shaker for continuous rhythm
- `conga.wav` - Tribal percussion for Latin influence
- `cowbell.wav` - Classic 808 cowbell for accents

### Fallback
- `fallback_drums.wav` - A fallback sample in case other samples fail to load

## Usage Tips

1. For authentic one drop reggae, emphasize the snare and kick on beat 3
2. Use rim shots for accents, especially on the "and" of beat 2
3. Hi-hats typically play eighth notes, with open hi-hats on the offbeats
4. Percussion elements should be mixed subtly to add texture without overwhelming
5. For dub effects, try processing the snare with delay and reverb

These samples can be combined to create complete reggae drum patterns or triggered individually for live performance.
